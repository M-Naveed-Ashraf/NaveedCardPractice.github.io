## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this practice project I have learned about flexbox which is very tricky part of CSS. we can use flexbox in situation where padding and margin can't help us.
Also I have learned about transform property in CSS and gooing to explore it in next projects In Sha Allah.


```css
footer {
    position: fixed;
    bottom: 0;
    width: 100%;
    display: flex;
    /* flex-flow: row; */
    justify-content: center;
}
}
```

### Continued development

I have learned about transform property in CSS and gooing to explore it in next projects In Sha Allah.
